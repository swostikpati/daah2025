# Analyzing Harry Potter and Fanfiction

Harry Potter has always been a series we both deeply enjoy, and analyzing it from a different perspective seemed like a fun challenge. We decided to focus on how J.K. Rowling’s writing evolved throughout the books, comparing the shifts in her style, themes, and focus with fanfiction works that reimagine her characters in new settings.

We chose to focus on the first and last books of the _Harry Potter_ series because they represent the beginning and end of Harry’s journey, showcasing his growth from an uncertain young boy to a confident young man.

- **The first book**, _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone_, introduces us to the magical world, with themes of discovery, friendship, and the clash between innocence and danger.
- **The last book**, _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_, deals with darker, more mature themes of loss, sacrifice, and the fight against evil, encapsulating the full arc of Harry's development.

Analyzing these two books provided us with a clear view of Rowling’s evolving writing style, as well as how her characters and themes matured over time.

## Fanfiction Comparison

As for the fanfiction, we were drawn to a story called _And I Will Find You_ by _lyingleia_, which reimagines Harry and Hermione’s connection in a world without magic, set in **New York City**.

- The choice of this fanfiction felt especially meaningful to us because, just like the characters, we are also students at **NYU**.
- The fanfiction focuses on the **emotional and personal growth** of Harry and Hermione as they navigate their lives in a world that lacks the magic they once knew.
- Through this setting, the fanfiction explores how Harry and Hermione, even without their magical abilities, continue to **rely on each other and grow**, making it a perfect parallel to the original books’ themes of friendship and personal growth.

## Why Computational Analysis?

By using **computer-assisted analysis**, we were able to examine these texts in ways that a traditional linear read wouldn't allow.

- Tools like **Voyant** and **the RMarkdown notebook in posit.cloud** helped us uncover **patterns, trends, and insights** that might have gone unnoticed during a regular reading, particularly with how **language** and **character dynamics** changed over time.
- This digital approach offered a **clearer view of Rowling's progression as an author**, especially in how her writing grew more complex alongside her characters.
- For example, we could see how **certain characters became more dominant in the later books**, as their emotional and moral growth took center stage.
- These shifts were **fascinating to track**, and computational tools made it **much easier** to identify them.

With the **limited time available**, a linear read of all the texts would not have been practical, making this approach **not only efficient but also insightful** in understanding the depth of the series and its fan creations.

## Language and Character Shifts

From our analysis, we discovered some **really interesting shifts** in language and character dynamics across the three books and the fanfiction.

### Word Frequency Insights

- For example in the first book, _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_, the word **"professor"** appears frequently, reflecting the central role of **Hogwarts** and its faculty as students navigate their new magical world.
- However, by the time we reach _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_, the same word is **far less prominent**, showing how the story transitions from the **structured school setting** to a **more chaotic, war-driven narrative**.

### Character Mentions

In all texts, **character names** rank among the **most frequent words** once common stopwords are removed:

<!-- screenshots from posit cloud about top words from every text -->

- Naturally, **“Harry”** dominates both the first and last Harry Potter books, reflecting his role as the protagonist.
- However, character mentions also reveal how relationships evolve over time. In _Sorcerer’s Stone_, **Hagrid** is referenced **more frequently** than **Hermione**, as the trio’s friendship had not yet fully formed.
- By _Deathly Hallows_, **Hermione** is mentioned **almost as often** as **Ron**, reflecting their **deepened bond** and equal importance in the final book.
- On the other hand, **Voldemort**, who is **rarely named** in the early books due to the fear surrounding him, becomes a **recurring presence** in the later books, as the characters **are no longer afraid** to speak his name.
- The word **"death"** is also notably **more common** in _Deathly Hallows_, signifying the **heavier themes of loss and sacrifice** that dominate the final installment.

## Fanfiction Language Differences

The fanfiction, _And I Will Find You_, differs significantly from the original Harry Potter books in both **focus and language**:
![Posit Graph](/daah2025/assets/images/graph_posit.jpg)

- The story centers **primarily** on **Harry and Hermione**, with **other major characters not making an appearance**.
- Notably, **Ron is never mentioned** at all in the fanfic, an omission that aligns with **a trend in certain fan communities** to sideline Ron to favor a Harry/Hermione pairing.
- This highlights a key difference: Rowling’s story is **ensemble-driven** (especially in the finale, which involves **dozens of characters**), while the fanfiction **cherry-picks only the author’s desired characters** for a **simplified cast**.
- The fanfiction's language is also **more grounded in the "Muggle" world**, with words like **“phone”, "class", and "notes"** taking on greater significance, as it is set in a world without magic.
- The fanfiction introduces **new characters**, such as **Sherry and Clara**, further distancing itself from the **familiar Hogwarts environment** and creating its own **unique narrative space**.

These differences offer an interesting contrast to the **canon books**, showing us how **fanfic authors** can reinterpret characters and themes within entirely new frameworks. In summary, **Rowling’s word frequencies** shift from the **innocent and magical** in **Book 1** to **darker and battle-driven** in **Book 7**, whereas the **fanfic’s frequent words** center on **everyday life and romance**, showing a completely different focus.

## Tonal Shift and Audience

- The tonal shift also reflects audience – **Rowling wrote Book 1 for children and Book 7 for teenagers** who had grown up with the series, hence the content got darker.
- The fanfic, meanwhile, is written **by and for fans (often young adults themselves)** indulging in an alternate scenario. The **emotional tone** of the fanfic is more aligned with **teen romance or young adult contemporary fiction**.
- There is angst (as any love story might have), but **not the pervasive fear or suspense** found in Rowling’s later books.
- One could say the **fanfic’s emotional stakes are lower** – no one’s life is in danger; it’s the stakes of **will-they-won’t-they** in love.

This creates a **fundamentally different reading experience**: _Philosopher’s Stone_ leaves readers with **a sense of magical joy** and the moral that **love conquers evil** in a simple way; _Deathly Hallows_ leaves readers with **a hard-earned catharsis**, having faced darkness and death; the **fanfic likely leaves readers with a sweet or heartwarming feeling** as it resolves the romantic tension. **Each accomplishes a distinct tone** to serve its story’s themes.

## Structural Differences

A **concrete structural difference** is **length**:

- _Philosopher’s Stone_ → **~77k words, 17 chapters, 223 pages**
- _Deathly Hallows_ → **~200k words, 36 chapters (plus an epilogue)**

The growth in length allowed **Rowling to incorporate more subplots, character backstories, and intricate details**.

- The **fanfiction** is **much shorter**, around **~7k words total**, divided into **a few brief chapters**, making it a **short novella or long one-shot**.
- The **pacing** of the fanfic is **tight and focused** on the central pairing, rather than the **expansive, journey-like pacing** of the novels.

Rowling’s **Book 1** moves through **an entire year at Hogwarts** (with seasonal structure), and **Book 7**, while mostly continuous in time, still covers **many months and a wide geographic range**. The **fanfic** compresses the narrative into **a few meetings and interactions in a single setting (NYU campus)** over, perhaps, weeks. Thus, structurally the **fanfic is simpler and more linear**, without the **breadth of events** seen in the books.

## Other Computational Insights

Our analysis of the **Collocates and TermBerry graphs** (generated by **Voyant Tools**) gave us **interesting insights** into how **character dynamics and themes evolved** across the Harry Potter series and how they were **reinterpreted in fanfiction**.

<iframe style='width: 566px; height: 399px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/TermsBerry/?view=TermsBerry&stopList=keywords-054dae2435b342f9cff0a4d0ebd5e7aa&corpus=ffdfbbcfa7475244b815befa1f39c66d'></iframe>
- The **Collocates graph** highlighted **Harry as the most central figure**, with **Ron and Hermione closely connected** but displaying **distinct roles**:

- Ron was more linked to **action-oriented words**, while Hermione's mentions leaned toward **intellectual contributions**. This distinction is almost exactly like their character development throughout the books.

- The contrast between the books and the fanfiction extended beyond character prominence. Similar to earlier findings, in _Sorcerer’s Stone_, words like **"professor" and "wand"** reinforced the **whimsical and educational nature** of the early series.
- On the other hand, _Deathly Hallows_ contained **darker themes**, with words like **"death"** becoming more frequent.
- **Sentence structure** evolved, with _Deathly Hallows_ having the **highest average words per sentence**, reflecting the **complexity and maturity** of Rowling’s writing by the final book.
- Meanwhile, the **fanfiction replaced magical elements with mundane vocabulary**, reinforcing its **modern, real-world setting**.

The **shift in tone and language structure** showed us how fan works often adapt original narratives to fit different **genres and themes**.

## References from Class Readings

The field of **digital humanities** has changed significantly over the past few decades, incorporating **computational methods** to expand traditional humanities research. **Berry (2019)** argues that digital humanities are not disrupting academia but rather continuing **humanistic inquiry** with the help of computational tools. He explains how techniques like **text analysis, visualization, and machine learning** allow scholars to work with large datasets in ways that were not possible before. This shift from **close reading** to **distant reading**—where researchers analyze patterns across thousands of texts—closely relates to our project. Using **digital text analysis tools** like **Voyant**, we examine **character prominence** and **thematic shifts** in both **fan fiction** and **original texts**. Computational methods help us uncover patterns that **traditional literary analysis** might miss, such as changes in **character dynamics** and **language use** across different narratives.

Similarly, **Rockwell and Sinclair (2017)** explore how **big data** impacts **text analysis**, discussing both its advantages and risks. They warn that computational methods can sometimes produce **false positives**—patterns that seem meaningful but do not actually hold interpretative value. This issue is especially relevant to our project, as we analyze large **text collections** to track trends in **character mentions** and **themes**. By using **visualization tools** and **statistical models**, we work to reduce misinterpretations and ensure our findings are supported by both **quantitative** and **qualitative analysis**. Our approach reflects the core of **digital humanities**: combining **computational methods** with **humanistic inquiry** to gain a deeper understanding of how characters like **Harry, Hermione, and Ron** are portrayed in **fan fiction** compared to the **original texts**.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, Rowling’s writing grew more intricate over time, both in **sentence complexity** and **thematic depth**, changing from an **adventurous, light-hearted story** to a **serious, emotionally charged epic**. The fanfiction, in contrast, took a more **grounded and personal approach**, stripping away the **magical stakes** in favor of **character relationships**. This comparison helped us see how **digital analysis** can reveal **patterns in storytelling**, showing both the **intentional shifts** made by an author over time and how readers **engage with and reinterpret** a story in their own creative ways.
