# Analyzing Harry Potter and Fanfiction

Harry Potter has always been a series we both deeply enjoy, and analyzing it from a different perspective seemed like a fun challenge. We decided to focus on how J.K. Rowling’s writing evolved throughout the books, comparing the shifts in her style, themes, and focus with fanfiction works that reimagine her characters in new settings.

We chose to focus on the first and last books of the _Harry Potter_ series because they represent the beginning and end of Harry’s journey, showcasing his growth from an uncertain young boy to a confident young man.

- **The first book**, _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone_, introduces us to the magical world, with themes of discovery, friendship, and the clash between innocence and danger.
- **The last book**, _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_, deals with darker, more mature themes of loss, sacrifice, and the fight against evil, encapsulating the full arc of Harry's development.

Analyzing these two books provided us with a clear view of Rowling’s evolving writing style, as well as how her characters and themes matured over time.

## Fanfiction Comparison

We were drawn to a story called _And I Will Find You_ by _lyingleia_, which reimagines Harry and Hermione’s connection in a world without magic, set in **New York City**.

- The choice of this fanfiction felt meaningful to us because, like the characters, we are also students at **NYU**.
- The fanfiction focuses on the **emotional and personal growth** of Harry and Hermione as they navigate life in a world without magic.
- It explores how they continue to **rely on each other and grow**, paralleling the original books’ themes of friendship and personal development.

## Computational Analysis

Using **computer-assisted analysis**, we examined these texts in ways a traditional linear read wouldn't allow.

- Tools like **Voyant** and **RMarkdown notebook in posit.cloud** helped us uncover **patterns, trends, and insights** that might have gone unnoticed.
- This digital approach **highlighted how language and character dynamics changed over time**, offering a clearer view of Rowling's progression as an author.
- For example, we noticed how certain characters became **more dominant** in later books as their emotional and moral growth took center stage.

With **limited time**, a linear read of all the texts would not have been practical, making this approach both **efficient and insightful**.

## Language and Character Shifts

We discovered some interesting shifts in **language and character dynamics** across the three books and the fanfiction:

- In _Sorcerer’s Stone_, the word **"professor"** appears frequently, reflecting the central role of **Hogwarts** and its faculty.
- By _Deathly Hallows_, the same word is far **less prominent**, showing the transition from **a structured school setting** to a **chaotic, war-driven narrative**.

Character mentions also reveal how relationships evolve:

- **Harry** dominates both books, reflecting his role as the protagonist.
- In _Sorcerer’s Stone_, **Hagrid** is referenced **more frequently** than Hermione, as the trio’s friendship was still forming.
- By _Deathly Hallows_, **Hermione** is mentioned almost as often as **Ron**, reflecting their deepened bond and equal importance.
- **Voldemort**, rarely named in early books due to fear, becomes a **recurring presence** in later books as characters are no longer afraid to speak his name.
- The word **"death"** is notably more common in _Deathly Hallows_, signifying its **darker themes of loss and sacrifice**.

### Fanfiction Language Differences

The fanfiction _And I Will Find You_ differs significantly from the original books in both **focus and language**:

- The story centers **only** on **Harry and Hermione**, with other major characters **absent** (e.g., **Ron is never mentioned**).
- This aligns with a **fan community trend** that sidelines Ron to favor a Harry/Hermione pairing.
- Rowling’s books are **ensemble-driven**, while this fanfiction focuses on a **simplified cast**.
- The fanfiction's language is **more grounded in reality**, with words like **"phone", "class", and "notes"** appearing frequently.
- New characters like **Sherry and Clara** replace Hogwarts figures, distancing the story from the magical world.

### Tone and Audience

- Rowling’s writing evolved from **lighthearted and adventurous** in _Sorcerer’s Stone_ to **dark and emotionally complex** in _Deathly Hallows_.
- The **fanfiction**, however, has a tone similar to **teen romance** or **young adult contemporary fiction**.
- Instead of the **high stakes** in _Deathly Hallows_, the fanfic focuses on **will-they-won’t-they romantic stakes**.
- _Philosopher’s Stone_ leaves readers with a sense of **magical joy**.
- _Deathly Hallows_ leaves readers with **hard-earned catharsis** after facing darkness and death.
- The **fanfiction**, in contrast, likely leaves readers with a **sweet or heartwarming feeling**.

## Structural Differences

- Rowling’s books **grew significantly** in size over the series:
  - _Philosopher’s Stone_ → **~77k words, 17 chapters, 223 pages**
  - _Deathly Hallows_ → **~200k words, 36 chapters + epilogue**
- More **subplots, backstories, and details** were incorporated into _Deathly Hallows_.
- The **fanfiction** is **much shorter** (~7k words total), structured as a **short novella**.
- The **pacing** of the fanfic is **tight and focused on the central pairing**, rather than the **expansive journey-like pacing** of the novels.
- Rowling’s books span **months** or even a **whole school year**, while the fanfiction **compresses events into a few meetings** in a single setting.

## Computational Insights

Our **Collocates and TermBerry graphs** (generated via **Voyant Tools**) provided insights into **character dynamics and themes**:

- **Collocates graph**:

  - _Harry_ is the most **central** figure.
  - _Ron_ is linked to **action words**, while _Hermione_ is associated with **intellectual contributions**.

- **Word Frequency Differences**:
  - In _Sorcerer’s Stone_, words like **"professor" and "wand"** highlight the **whimsical and educational nature**.
  - In _Deathly Hallows_, words like **"death"** reinforce the **darker themes**.
  - _Deathly Hallows_ has **longer average sentence lengths**, reflecting the complexity of Rowling’s writing over time.
  - The **fanfiction** replaces magical elements with **mundane vocabulary**, reinforcing its **modern setting**.

## Conclusion

- **Rowling’s writing grew more intricate** over time, increasing in **sentence complexity and thematic depth**.
- Her story **transitioned** from an **adventurous tale** to an **emotionally charged epic**.
- The **fanfiction**, in contrast, took a **more personal and grounded approach**, focusing on **relationships over magic**.
- **Digital analysis** revealed **patterns in storytelling**, showing both how an **author’s work evolves** and how **readers reinterpret** stories in creative ways.
