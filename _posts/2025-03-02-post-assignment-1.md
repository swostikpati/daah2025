# Analyzing Harry Potter and Fanfiction

Harry Potter has always been a series we both deeply enjoy, and analyzing it from a different perspective seemed like a fun challenge. We decided to focus on how J.K. Rowling’s writing evolved throughout the books, comparing the shifts in her style, themes, and focus with fanfiction works that reimagine her characters in new settings.

We chose to focus on the first and last books of the _Harry Potter_ series because they represent the beginning and end of Harry’s journey, showcasing his growth from an uncertain young boy to a confident young man.

- **The first book**, _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone_, introduces us to the magical world, with themes of discovery, friendship, and the clash between innocence and danger.
- **The last book**, _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_, deals with darker, more mature themes of loss, sacrifice, and the fight against evil, encapsulating the full arc of Harry's development.

Analyzing these two books provided us with a clear view of Rowling’s evolving writing style, as well as how her characters and themes matured over time.

## Fanfiction Comparison

As for the fanfiction, we were drawn to a story called _And I Will Find You_ by _lyingleia_, which reimagines Harry and Hermione’s connection in a world without magic, set in **New York City**.

- The choice of this fanfiction felt especially meaningful to us because, just like the characters, we are also students at **NYU**.
- The fanfiction focuses on the **emotional and personal growth** of Harry and Hermione as they navigate their lives in a world that lacks the magic they once knew.
- Through this setting, the fanfiction explores how Harry and Hermione, even without their magical abilities, continue to **rely on each other and grow**, making it a perfect parallel to the original books’ themes of friendship and personal growth.

## Computational Analysis

By using **computer-assisted analysis**, we were able to examine these texts in ways that a traditional linear read wouldn't allow.

- Tools like **Voyant** and **the RMarkdown notebook in posit.cloud** helped us uncover **patterns, trends, and insights** that might have gone unnoticed during a regular reading.
- This digital approach offered a **clearer view of Rowling's progression as an author**, especially in how her writing grew more complex alongside her characters.
- For example, we could see how **certain characters became more dominant in the later books**, as their emotional and moral growth took center stage.
- These shifts were **fascinating to track**, and computational tools made it **much easier** to identify them.

With the **limited time available**, a linear read of all the texts would not have been practical, making this approach **not only efficient but also insightful** in understanding the depth of the series and its fan creations.

## Language and Character Shifts

From our analysis, we discovered some **really interesting shifts** in language and character dynamics across the three books and the fanfiction.

### Word Frequency Insights

- In _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_, the word **"professor"** appears frequently, reflecting the central role of **Hogwarts** and its faculty as students navigate their new magical world.
- By the time we reach _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_, the same word is **far less prominent**, showing how the story transitions from the **structured school setting** to a **more chaotic, war-driven narrative**.

### Character Mentions

In all texts, **character names** rank among the **most frequent words** once common stopwords are removed:

- **“Harry”** dominates both the first and last Harry Potter books, reflecting his role as the protagonist.
- In _Sorcerer’s Stone_, **Hagrid** is referenced **more frequently** than **Hermione**, as the trio’s friendship had not yet fully formed.
- By _Deathly Hallows_, **Hermione** is mentioned **almost as often** as **Ron**, reflecting their **deepened bond** and equal importance in the final book.
- **Voldemort**, who is **rarely named** in the early books due to fear, becomes a **recurring presence** in the later books, as characters **are no longer afraid** to speak his name.
- The word **"death"** is also notably **more common** in _Deathly Hallows_, signifying the **heavier themes of loss and sacrifice** that dominate the final installment.

## Fanfiction Language Differences

The fanfiction, _And I Will Find You_, differs significantly from the original Harry Potter books in both **focus and language**:

- The story centers **primarily** on **Harry and Hermione**, with **other major characters not making an appearance**.
- Notably, **Ron is never mentioned** at all in the fanfic, an omission that aligns with **a trend in certain fan communities** to sideline Ron to favor a Harry/Hermione pairing.
- Rowling’s story is **ensemble-driven**, especially in the finale, which involves **dozens of characters**, while the fanfiction **cherry-picks only the author’s desired characters** for a **simplified cast**.
- The fanfiction's language is **more grounded in the "Muggle" world**, with words like **“phone”, "class", and "notes"** taking on greater significance.
- The fanfiction introduces **new characters**, such as **Sherry and Clara**, further distancing itself from the **familiar Hogwarts environment** and creating its own **unique narrative space**.

## Structural Differences

A **concrete structural difference** is **length**:

- _Philosopher’s Stone_ → **~77k words, 17 chapters, 223 pages**
- _Deathly Hallows_ → **~200k words, 36 chapters (plus an epilogue)**

The growth in length allowed **Rowling to incorporate more subplots, character backstories, and intricate details**.

- The **fanfiction** is **much shorter**, around **~7k words total**, divided into **a few brief chapters**, making it a **short novella or long one-shot**.
- The **pacing** of the fanfic is **tight and focused** on the central pairing, rather than the **expansive, journey-like pacing** of the novels.
- Rowling’s books span **months** or even a **whole school year**, while the fanfiction **compresses the narrative** into **a few meetings** in a **single setting** (NYU campus) over, perhaps, **weeks**.

## Computational Insights

Our analysis of the **Collocates and TermBerry graphs** (generated by **Voyant Tools**) gave us **interesting insights** into how **character dynamics and themes evolved** across the Harry Potter series and how they were **reinterpreted in fanfiction**.

- The **Collocates graph** highlighted **Harry as the most central figure**, with **Ron and Hermione closely connected** but displaying **distinct roles**:

  - Ron was more linked to **action-oriented words**, while Hermione's mentions leaned toward **intellectual contributions**.

- In _Sorcerer’s Stone_, words like **"professor" and "wand"** reinforced the **whimsical and educational nature** of the early series.
- _Deathly Hallows_ contained **darker themes**, with words like **"death"** becoming more frequent.
- **Sentence structure** evolved, with _Deathly Hallows_ having the **highest average words per sentence**, reflecting the **complexity and maturity** of Rowling’s writing by the final book.

Meanwhile, the **fanfiction replaced magical elements with mundane vocabulary**, reinforcing its **modern, real-world setting**.

## Conclusion

- Rowling’s **writing grew more intricate over time**, increasing in **sentence complexity and thematic depth**.
- Her story **transitioned** from an **adventurous, light-hearted** tale to a **serious, emotionally charged epic**.
- The **fanfiction**, in contrast, took a **more grounded and personal approach**, stripping away the magical stakes in favor of **character relationships**.
- **Digital analysis** revealed **patterns in storytelling**, showing both the **intentional shifts made by an author over time** and how **readers engage with and reinterpret a story in their own creative ways**.
