### Reflections on Digital Literacy: A University Student’s Perspective

As a 22-year-old university student at a liberal arts institution, I find myself taking classes and engaging in content at the intersection of the arts and sciences. From this what I have realized overtime, especially through our class discussion is that digital literacy is not just about knowing how to navigate a computer or use social media; but rather it is about being able to effectively understand, critique, and utilize various digital tools for both personal and academic purposes.

My daily life is extremely saturated with technology, and yet, I recognize that I am only scratching the surface of what it means to be digitally literate in a period where dozens of very capable AI tools are coming in every day.

### Digital Literacy in Content Creation and Social Interaction

As a Computer Science and Interactive Media double major, I frequently utilize platforms such as GitHub and LinkedIn to share my projects, read technical articles, etc. I have friends who use Medium to communicate insights or tutorials related to software development and interactive design. Peers in Interactive Media similarly leverage tools like Unity/Unreal Engine for game development, Figma for UI/UX design and prototyping interactive experiences. Regardless of the specific digital tool, we collectively depend on online platforms to share our work, receive feedback, and collaborate effectively.

Social interaction are equally important for the social interaction aspect of digital literacy. Applications such as Discord, Slack, and Notion have become essential for managing collaborative coding projects, hackathons, etc. I might use LinkedIn or Twitter to network professionally, discuss recent technological advancements, or showcase my interactive media projects. My peers focused on digital art or interactive installations often curate their portfolios on platforms like Behance or use Instagram to share visual work. Recognizing both the capabilities and constraints of these platforms is crucial and deciding based on our own capabilites and experiences, I think becomes a big part of using these technologies.

### Digital Research and Data Management

Managing and analyzing research data is another essential component of digital literacy. For example, I used Zotero to organizing citations for my Capstone paper. My peers in Art and Art History rely on databases like JSTOR for research. Understanding how to efficiently manage digital information and setting systems that work for us improves research efficiency.

Data manipulation and analysis have also become central to my academic experience. As an Econ minor, I frequently use Python and libraries such as pandas and matplotlib for data visualization, particularly when analyzing economic or user behavior data. For interactive media projects, tools like Google Analytics and Plausible help me understand audience interactions and engagement patterns in my websites. This interdisciplinary toolkit allows me to integrate computational methods to support understanding and critical inquiry, demonstrating the potential of digital approaches. It also helps to combine my knowledge across computer science, interactive media, and economics.

### Digital Humanities and New Horizons in Learning

The field of digital humanities provides an interdisciplinary space where traditional analog data meets computational methods. Before taking courses in digital humanities, I had not intentionally thought about computational analysis of analog material, even though it was so widespread all around us. I viewed textual analysis as a primarily close-reading endeavor, even though I had used OCR for scanned documents for some classes in the past - never really paying the deeper attention needed to realize what I was actually doing in the process. Through exposure to the different methods we have used in class, I have begun to see literature not just as a collection of individual texts but as part of larger, analyzable systems. Digital humanities expand what is possible in the field like network analysis of a corpus of texts (for example our analysis of Harry Potter in assignment 1).

Digital humanities, as described by Professor David M. Berry, involve applying advanced computational methods such as statistical analysis, topic modeling, and data visualization to archives and collections that are significantly larger than what a single researcher can manually manage. These methods enable interdisciplinary teams to undertake ambitious and complex research projects, fundamentally changing our understanding of what humanities research can entail. For example, digital tools make it possible to not only analyze vast amounts of digitized cultural material but also to seamlessly integrate diverse datasets including texts, social media, images, and sound archives. This not only enhances the ability of humanists to produce richer, multi-dimensional analyses but also encourages greater collaboration across disciplines, pushing humanities scholarship into new, transformative directions.

Recently, during a conversation on LinkedIn with Dr. Samsurin Welch, Co-Founder at HyveGEO, Dr. Welch mentioned that he was exploring how to use AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to extract and curate data from numerous academic PDFs about biochar. He highlighted challenges like the unreliability of traditional OCR methods and was curious whether newer models like Mistral might be effective. This interaction immediately made me realize that this is exactly what we do in class and how prevalant the use of digital humanities is. This shows how closely our classroom discussions align with real-world research issues, especially the challenges of applying AI to messy, real-world analog data.

Going further, in the reading by Barry Smith on the limits of AI and the importance of practical knowledge, I found parallels with Dr. Welch's concerns. Smith argues that certain intellectual tasks - such as interpreting nuanced scientific data or engaging with complex systems — cannot be fully captured by current AI models due to their reliance on practical, tacit knowledge. He emphasizes that tasks involving complex judgments or context-dependent interpretations, like those Dr. Welch mentioned, often exceed the capabilities of AI systems. This made me realize that developing effective computational approaches to humanities research is both challenging and cannot be fully automated without adding a certain degree of human judgment.

### Critical Reflections on My Digital Abilities and Future Growth

Despite my growing proficiency in digital research tools, I recognize gaps in my understanding. I would like to develop deeper expertise in this realm and learn to leverage AI even more as so many really unique and useful tools are coming out everyday. AI presents new possibilities in creative writing, from generative text models to interactive storytelling experiences, and I am very curious about how these tools can be creatively used. I also hope to one day be able to build my own LLM-based tool capable of widening the scope of services offered by AI.

Additionally, I also want to explore the ethical dimensions of digital work. How do biases in AI systems shape the way information is processed? How can we ensure that digital tools do not reinforce systemic inequalities and biases in academia and beyond? Digital literacy is not just about technical proficiency but also about developing a critical lens through which we can evaluate digital systems and their impact on society.

### Conclusion

As I continue my journey through university, I am excited to deepen my engagement with digital humanities and computational thinking. I believe digital literacy is not a static skill set but an ever-evolving practice that requires constant learning and adaptation. By embracing interdisciplinary collaboration, critically reflecting on digital tools - their abilities and limitations, - and exploring new ways of approaching data, I hope to cultivate a digital fluency that is both technically sound and ethically informed. The liberal arts, with their emphasis on holistic learning, provide the perfect environment for this exploration - one where the humanities and technology work together to enrich our understanding of the world.
