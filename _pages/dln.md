### Reflections on Digital Literacy: A University Student’s Perspective

As a 22-year-old university student at a liberal arts institution, I find myself taking classes and engaging in content at the intersection of the arts and sciences. From this what I have realized overtime, especially through our class discussion is that digital literacy is not just about knowing how to navigate a computer or use social media; but rather it is about being able to effectively understand, critique, and utilize various digital tools for both personal and academic purposes.

My daily life is extremely saturated with technology, and yet, I recognize that I am only scratching the surface of what it means to be digitally literate in a period where dozens of very capable AI tools are coming in every day.

### Digital Literacy in Content Creation and Social Interaction

As a Computer Science and Interactive Media double major, I frequently utilize platforms such as GitHub and LinkedIn to share my projects, read technical articles, etc. I have friends who use Medium to communicate insights or tutorials related to software development and interactive design. Peers in Interactive Media similarly leverage tools like Unity/Unreal Engine for game development, Figma for UI/UX design and prototyping interactive experiences. Regardless of the specific digital tool, we collectively depend on online platforms to share our work, receive feedback, and collaborate effectively.

Social interaction are equally important for the social interaction aspect of digital literacy. Applications such as Discord, Slack, and Notion have become essential for managing collaborative coding projects, hackathons, etc. I might use LinkedIn or Twitter to network professionally, discuss recent technological advancements, or showcase my interactive media projects. My peers focused on digital art or interactive installations often curate their portfolios on platforms like Behance or use Instagram to share visual work. Recognizing both the capabilities and constraints of these platforms is crucial and deciding based on our own capabilites and experiences, I think becomes a big part of using these technologies.

### Digital Research and Data Management

Managing and analyzing research data is another essential component of digital literacy. For example, I used Zotero to organizing citations for my Capstone paper. My peers in Art and Art History rely on databases like JSTOR for research. Understanding how to efficiently manage digital information and setting systems that work for us improves research efficiency.

Data manipulation and analysis have also become central to my academic experience. As an Econ minor, I frequently use Python and libraries such as pandas and matplotlib for data visualization, particularly when analyzing economic or user behavior data. For interactive media projects, tools like Google Analytics and Plausible help me understand audience interactions and engagement patterns in my websites. This interdisciplinary toolkit allows me to integrate computational methods to support understanding and critical inquiry, demonstrating the potential of digital approaches. It also helps to combine my knowledge across computer science, interactive media, and economics.

### Digital Humanities and New Horizons in Learning

The field of digital humanities provides an interdisciplinary space where traditional humanistic inquiry meets computational methods. Before taking courses in digital humanities, I viewed textual analysis as a primarily close-reading endeavor. However, through exposure to machine learning models for sentiment analysis and topic modeling, I have begun to see literature not just as a collection of individual texts but as part of larger, analyzable systems. Digital humanities expand what is possible in my field, from network analysis of characters in novels to computational studies of authorship attribution.

This exposure has also deepened my understanding of computational thinking, as described by Berry and Fagerjord—not just as programming but as a cognitive practice that involves practical wisdom and reflection on computation itself. In collaborative settings, my peers and I negotiate different approaches to problems: a computer science student might suggest algorithmic sorting for a dataset, while a literature student like myself might emphasize the ethical implications of data collection. These interdisciplinary discussions challenge us to develop nuanced perspectives on digital methods, recognizing both their potential and their limitations.

### Critical Reflections on My Digital Abilities and Future Growth

Despite my growing proficiency in digital research tools, I recognize gaps in my understanding. While I am comfortable with basic text mining and visualization techniques, I would like to develop deeper expertise in natural language processing and data storytelling. AI presents new frontiers in creative writing, from generative text models to interactive storytelling experiences, and I am curious about how these tools can be critically and creatively engaged.

Additionally, I want to explore the ethical dimensions of digital work. How do biases in AI systems shape the way information is processed and disseminated? How can we ensure that digital tools do not reinforce systemic inequalities in academia and beyond? Digital literacy is not just about technical proficiency but about developing a critical lens through which to evaluate digital systems and their impact on society.

### Conclusion

As I continue my journey through university, I am excited to deepen my engagement with digital humanities and computational thinking. Digital literacy is not a static skill set but an evolving practice that requires constant learning and adaptation. By embracing interdisciplinary collaboration, critically reflecting on digital tools, and exploring new ways of approaching data, I hope to cultivate a digital fluency that is both technically sound and ethically informed. The liberal arts, with their emphasis on holistic learning, provide the perfect environment for this exploration—one where the humanities and technology do not stand in opposition but work together to enrich our understanding of the world.
