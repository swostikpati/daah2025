### Reflections on Digital Literacy: A University Student’s Perspective

As a 20-year-old university student at a liberal arts institution, I find myself at the intersection of digital fluency and critical inquiry. Digital literacy is not just about knowing how to navigate a computer or use social media; it is about understanding, critiquing, and effectively utilizing digital tools in both academic and personal contexts. My daily and academic life is saturated with technology, and yet, I recognize that I am only scratching the surface of what it means to be digitally literate in an era increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, data-driven decision-making, and computational thinking.

### Digital Literacy in Content Creation and Social Interaction

Digital literacy informs how I engage with content creation and social interaction. For instance, as a Literature and Creative Writing major, I use platforms like Medium and Substack to publish essays, engage with communities of writers, and receive constructive feedback. My peers in Film and New Media might be adept at using Adobe Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve for video editing, while those studying Interactive Media might be creating augmented reality experiences or designing user interfaces with Figma. Regardless of discipline, we all rely on digital platforms to distribute our work, communicate with audiences, and collaborate with others.

Social interaction is similarly shaped by digital fluency. Tools like Discord, Slack, and Trello facilitate collaborative academic projects and extracurricular activities. While I might use Instagram or TikTok to share creative writing snippets or engage with literature-focused communities, my peers in Art History might curate digital exhibitions on platforms like Google Arts & Culture. Understanding the affordances and limitations of these platforms is a crucial skill—one that extends beyond social engagement to how we construct and critique digital narratives.

### Digital Research and Data Management

Managing and analyzing research data is another essential component of digital literacy. For example, I use Zotero to organize citations for literary analysis papers, while my friends in Computer Science might use GitHub for version control in coding projects. My peers in Art and Art History rely on databases like JSTOR and Artstor for research, while those in Interactive Media might employ Unity or Unreal Engine to prototype interactive experiences. Understanding how to efficiently manage digital information not only improves research efficiency but also fosters critical engagement with sources.

Moreover, data manipulation and analysis have become integral to various disciplines. I have experimented with Voyant Tools to conduct textual analysis of literary works, uncovering hidden patterns in large corpora of texts. Meanwhile, my peers in Computer Science use Python and R for data visualization, and those in Film and New Media analyze audience engagement metrics using Google Analytics. Each discipline has its own toolkit, yet digital humanities offer a bridge between them, demonstrating how computational approaches can enrich our understanding of literature, art, and media.

### Digital Humanities and New Horizons in Learning

The field of digital humanities provides an interdisciplinary space where traditional humanistic inquiry meets computational methods. Before taking courses in digital humanities, I viewed textual analysis as a primarily close-reading endeavor. However, through exposure to machine learning models for sentiment analysis and topic modeling, I have begun to see literature not just as a collection of individual texts but as part of larger, analyzable systems. Digital humanities expand what is possible in my field, from network analysis of characters in novels to computational studies of authorship attribution.

This exposure has also deepened my understanding of computational thinking, as described by Berry and Fagerjord—not just as programming but as a cognitive practice that involves practical wisdom and reflection on computation itself. In collaborative settings, my peers and I negotiate different approaches to problems: a computer science student might suggest algorithmic sorting for a dataset, while a literature student like myself might emphasize the ethical implications of data collection. These interdisciplinary discussions challenge us to develop nuanced perspectives on digital methods, recognizing both their potential and their limitations.

### Critical Reflections on My Digital Abilities and Future Growth

Despite my growing proficiency in digital research tools, I recognize gaps in my understanding. While I am comfortable with basic text mining and visualization techniques, I would like to develop deeper expertise in natural language processing and data storytelling. AI presents new frontiers in creative writing, from generative text models to interactive storytelling experiences, and I am curious about how these tools can be critically and creatively engaged.

Additionally, I want to explore the ethical dimensions of digital work. How do biases in AI systems shape the way information is processed and disseminated? How can we ensure that digital tools do not reinforce systemic inequalities in academia and beyond? Digital literacy is not just about technical proficiency but about developing a critical lens through which to evaluate digital systems and their impact on society.

### Conclusion

As I continue my journey through university, I am excited to deepen my engagement with digital humanities and computational thinking. Digital literacy is not a static skill set but an evolving practice that requires constant learning and adaptation. By embracing interdisciplinary collaboration, critically reflecting on digital tools, and exploring new ways of approaching data, I hope to cultivate a digital fluency that is both technically sound and ethically informed. The liberal arts, with their emphasis on holistic learning, provide the perfect environment for this exploration—one where the humanities and technology do not stand in opposition but work together to enrich our understanding of the world.
